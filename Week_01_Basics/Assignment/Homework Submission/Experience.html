			<p><h5> VOLUNTEER YOUTH COORDINATOR: THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY FAMILY</h5>
			As the youth group leader at the Church of the Holy Family in Maroubra, I have been entrusted with a responsibility to facilitate personal, social and religious growth in local high school youth, which is aligned with Catholic faith and values. To achieve this I have established a fun and enjoyable forum where high school students can regularly come to explore elements of faith, family and social responsibilities. No matter what the students' religious background or opinions are, we encourage all in attendance to participate in respectful discussions and critical reflection. With each meeting, I aim to present upstanding examples of morality, charity and justice. I have witnessed the group attendance grow from an average of 5 teens to 12 teens per meeting.</p>

		<p><h5>VOLUNTEER MENTOR: BIG BROTHER/BID SISTER OF NORTHWEST TOLEDO</h5>
		As a mentor with BBBS, I was given the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of underprivileged youths. While paired with the youth, I worked to develop a plan of action to address the main problems troubling the youth. I educated the child in positive decision-making that could be implemented as the youth grows into a teen and young adult. Encouraging the child to learn while having fun is a major part of the program. The most rewarding aspect of this opportunity was assisting the family with organising schedules for school, family and social time to put the youth in a position that gives them the best chance for future success.</p>

		<P><h5>VOLUNTEER: THE BETHANY HOUSE, TOLEDO OHIO</h5>
		My volunteering at The Bethany House had the biggest impact on my life. The Bethany House is a shelter for victims of domestic violence and their children. As a volunteer, my job was to bring a little joy back into the lives of these children who have had a life tougher than some adults. I assisted the family with babysitting as their mothers looked for work, helped with homework, became a playmate and offered a listening ear as needed.</p>
